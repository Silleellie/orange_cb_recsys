class EmbeddingSource(ABC):
    """
    General class whose purpose is to store the loaded pre-trained embeddings model and extract specified data from it

    The embedding source works in the following way: data -> model -> embedding vector
    The source iterates over all the data and returns the embedding vectors (in a matrix)

    EmbeddingSource has two classes that inherit from it: EmbeddingLoader and EmbeddingLearner. The first is used
    for models downloadable from the internet or stored locally (in particular, models that cannot be trained),
    the second is used for models stored locally that can be trained. Because of this, there
    shouldn't be any need for any other classes

    model: embeddings model loaded from source

        reference (str): where to find the model, could be the model name to download or the path where the model is
            located

        Function that extracts from the embeddings model the vectors of the data contained in text. If the model can't
        return a vector for the data passed as argument, then a vector filled with 0 will be created.

        Args:
            text (list<str>): text from which the embedding vectors will be extracted. The text contents depend from the
                embedding source's granularity. For example, a word embedding source will contain a list of tokens.

            embedding_matrix (np.ndarray): numpy vector, where each row represents the vector for the granularity (if
                the source has sentence granularity, the vector will refer to the corresponding sentence).
                Assuming text is a list of length N (where N depends by the granularity of the technique, so it could
                be the number of words or sentences), embedding_matrix will be N-dimensional.
