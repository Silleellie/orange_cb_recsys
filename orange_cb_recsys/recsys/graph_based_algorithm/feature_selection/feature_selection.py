class FeatureSelectionAlgorithm(ABC):
    """
    Feature Selection algorithm class. It contains all the methods to use Feature Selection on a Full Graph.
    The main method to do so is the perform method.

    All the Feature Selection algorithms will create a new graph based on the one passed by the user. This new graph
    will contain only the Item or the User nodes from the original graph but the Property nodes will be different.
    Instead of having the property instance (for example: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phil_Collins) the Property nodes
    in the new graph will have the property names associated to the property instance (for example: 'starring').
    This is retrieved because the label of the edge connecting a User or Item node to a Property node will be the
    Property name. So, for example:

        Item Node someitem -- (label: starring) --> Property Node http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phil_Collins

        will be transformed to

        Item Node someitem ----> Property Node starring

    This is done so that only the instances related to the most important properties will be kept in the original graph

    After creating the new graph, an algorithm which can compute the 'importance' scores for each node in the new graph
    is used (for example, PageRank) and the Property nodes (in this case being the property labels of the original
    graph) with the best scores will be returned

    Args:
        additional_arguments (dict): it's possible to pass the parameters one would normally pass to the scores
            computation algorithms (for example, if the PageRank from networkx is used to compute the scores for
            each node, this parameter can contain the additional parameters for said method)
