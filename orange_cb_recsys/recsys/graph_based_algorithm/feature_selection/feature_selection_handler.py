class FeatureSelectionHandler:
    """
    Class that handles the Feature Selection process. It allows to define a Feature Selection algorithm that will be
    used both for feature selection on user properties and on item properties. The Handler will perform feature
    selection on user properties first and on item properties after that. After obtaining the results from the
    Feature Selection algorithms (which will return the list of properties to keep), the Handler creates a copy of
    the original graph and removes any Property node which edges' labels are not in the list of properties to keep
    For example:

            Item some_item_node --label: a_property--> Property some_property_node

    If a_property is not in the list of properties to keep, the Property node is removed (note that other labels
    referring to that Property node should always be 'a_property')

    The goal is to remove the less useful Property Nodes so that
    the ranking and prediction graph based algorithms have to explore less nodes during computation
